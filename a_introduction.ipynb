    "# **`WebSocket`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`Definition`:**\n",
    "A WebSocket is a full‑duplex, low‑latency communication protocol built on top of TCP that allows both the client and the server to send messages over a single, persistent connection. Unlike traditional HTTP where the client must poll the server for updates, the WebSocket API permits the browser to open a two‑way interactive session with the server and exchange messages without repeatedly re‑establishing connections. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **`WebSocket`** is like opening a phone call between a browser and a server.\n",
    "Once the call is connected, both sides can talk to each other anytime, instantly, without hanging up and dialing again. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, normal HTTP is like sending letters: the browser sends a request, waits for a reply, and the connection closes. If it wants more updates, it has to send another letter. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With WebSockets, the connection stays open, and messages flow both ways in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`Why We Need WebSockets (Advantages)`:**\n",
    "* **Real‑time Bidirectional Communication:** Both the client and the server can send data whenever they need to without waiting for the other side, which is particularly important for interactive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficiency and low overhead:** Messages travel over a single TCP connection and avoid the overhead of HTTP headers; this reduces bandwidth and latency compared with repeated HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Eliminates Polling:** With WebSockets the server can push updates to the client instantly; there’s no need to constantly poll the server as with AJAX or long‑polling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supported by modern Browsers:** All major browsers implement the WebSocket protocol, which makes it a practical choice for web‑based real‑time applications.\n",

    "| **Use‑Case**                                             | **How WebSockets Help**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Evidence**                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

    "| **Chat and Messaging Apps**                          | Chat services require immediate, bidirectional updates so that users see messages instantly and can send feedback or reactions. WebSockets provide the low‑latency, persistent channel necessary for this, avoiding repeated HTTP requests.                                                                                                                    | Articles on the protocol highlight that WebSockets are “perfect for sending data quickly between the server and clients, such as instant chat applications”. |\n",
    "| **Online Multiplayer Games & Live Dashboards**       | Fast game state updates and leaderboards must reach players at once; delays can ruin the experience. WebSockets allow servers to push updates to every connected player without polling and handle high throughput.  Live dashboards (e.g., stock tickers, cryptocurrency prices or sports scores) also rely on streaming updates directly to the browser.     |                                                                                                                                                              |\n",
    "| **Collaborative Editing & Document Synchronization** | Tools like collaborative text editors or whiteboards need to synchronize edits across participants in real time. WebSockets maintain a continuous channel so that every keystroke can be broadcast to other users instantly.  A tutorial on WebSockets describes building a real‑time collaborative text editor where changes are synchronized across clients. |                                                                                                                                                              |\n"
